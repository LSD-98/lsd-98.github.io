**Abstract:** Sustainable finance is criticized for its limited capacity to deliver systemic societal impact. Existing research has primarily focused on interactions between investors and companies, neglecting investment firms' internal governance and organizational characteristics. This paper examines how investment organizations can be structured to achieve financial and societal goals systematically by studying the upstream interactions between asset managers and asset owners. We build on a longitudinal case study of a private equity impact fund focused on environmental transitions approached through ethnography, interviews, and archival data. Our findings highlight the critical role of the fund's organizational architecture—encompassing value-creation objectives, operational resources, and governance mechanisms—which is determined before its active life on the market. This architecture shapes the behavior of the asset manager throughout the fund’s lifecycle. We also show how hybridizing the organizational architecture by integrating elements from financial and environmental logics can foster subsequent investment and monitoring practices geared toward systemic impact, by driving alignment between financial and environmental goals. By uncovering the upstream organizational mechanisms determining investors' behavior in the financial markets, this research contributes to the literature on sustainable finance and corporate governance and calls for increased transparency and disclosure of the key characteristics of investment organizations' architecture.
