    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## Hi, I'm Léo! 👋 

I am a PhD Candidate in Management Science at Ecole Polytechnique and a Fellow at the Center for Management Studies (i3, UMR CNRS 9217). Before joining Polytechnique, I graduated from Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay in Economics & Management. I also worked in the private equity sector (Trocadero Capital Partners, Cathay Capital) between 2020 and 2024. Most of my research focuses on the development of sustainable finance in the private markets, and whether & how it can positively impact society.

My work is supported by ANRT, Trocadero Capital Partners (CIFRE) and professional organizations (Forum pour l'Investissement Responsable, Association française des Investisseurs Institutionnels).
