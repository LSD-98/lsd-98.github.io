**Abstract:** In the context of the major challenges we face, some shareholders are pushing companies to
develop robust sustainability (or “ESG”) strategies, notably through shareholder engagement practices.
This article explores these practices and their effectiveness through the case of different coalitions of
investors engaging TotalEnergies SE (a French oil major). We show that these small minority
shareholders can have a significant influence on corporate sustainability strategies (even in the highly
restrictive French context) by catalyzing the external pressure exerted by its stakeholders, notably
through precise collaboration mechanisms that avoid interference and pressure from management. The
“success” of these approaches is nevertheless ambiguous and must be analyzed in the light of the target
company's long-term societal impact. This ambiguity should not overshadow the role of the regulator in
environmental and social transition.
